# NPM Package Template

You wrote a sweet piece of code! Releasing it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
seems like the obvious next step. Right?

_Try it!_ Not as easy to do as you might think. At high quality. From scratch.

So here's a plug-and-play NPM package template that offers the following
features:

- Tree-shakable support for the latest ES6 goodies with
  [`eslint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) _uber alles_.

- CJS distributions targeting specific browser support scenarios.

- Command line interfaces for your widget with
  [`commander`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander).

- Automated [`lodash`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) cherry-picking with
  [`babel-plugin-lodash`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-lodash).

- [`mocha`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) &
  [`chai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) for testing, with examples, and a
  sweet testing console.

- In-code access to
  [`package.json`](https://github.com/karmaniverous/npm-package-template/blob/main/package.json)
  data, with no warnings to ignore.

- Code formatting at every save & paste with
  [`prettier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier).

- Automated documentation of your API with
  [`jsdoc-to-markdown`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdoc-to-markdown) and
  assembly of your README with
  [`concat-md`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concat-md).

- One-button release to GitHub & publish to NPM with
  [`release-it`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it).
